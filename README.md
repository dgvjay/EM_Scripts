# Introduction
A collection of scripts that I use to help process my cryo-electron tomography data.  I am starting this repository with only a handful of scripts; I will continue to add more. Most of these are Wrapper scripts that rely on other programs and scripts

# How to use
The description for the usage of each script can be found in its commented header or with the -h flag when running them (if Python script)
